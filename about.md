This is a user group for all Java/JVM developers (or those who are interested in Java/JVM development) in Seville (Andalucia), or those just passing through.  The topics will probably overlap into other areas, like TDD/BDD, Agile, Software Craftsmanship.

Most importantly, this is a place for techies to get together, meet each other, and hopefully have a drink or two while having "lively" conversations.

Las charlas serán tanto en inglés como en español.
